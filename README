* This is the "cmake" branch of opm-core. Its purpose is to use CMake instead of
  Autotools as building system. It should be viewed as an experimental branch, and
  is not (yet) suitable to use as a base for further development of the C++ code.

* Please do not push changes to this branch as there are several changes locally
  in the patch queue. Instead, make a pull request on GitHub.

* If you build the library as a shared object on a 64-bit Linux platform, then
  ERT should be built using the option -DSHARED_LIB:BOOL=ON

* Documentation and tests are not built by default; if you want to build it, use
  the commands "make doc" and "make tests" respectively. (The "build" script can
  also be used in this manner). Building these components will take significantly
  longer time than just the library.

* If you want to try out this branch together with the latest changes in the main
  branch, do this:

  git clone -b cmake http://github.com/OPM/opm-core opm-core-cmake
  pushd opm-core-cmake
  git pull --strategy=ours origin master

* Steps to build using CMake:

  cmake ../../src/opm-core -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug && \
  make

* In particular, you must set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE when running CMake, to enable
  debugging within QtCreator.

* Notice that a very simple form of 'configure' also works. Use `configure --help`
  to see available options. A faster version of the above commands is:

  ../../src/opm-core/configure --prefix=/usr/local && \
  ../../src/opm-core/build
