* This is the "cmake" branch of opm-core. Its purpose is to use CMake instead of
  Autotools as building system. It should be viewed as an experimental branch, and
  is not (yet) suitable to use as a base for further development of the C++ code.

* Please do not push changes to this branch.

* The following features are deliberately disabled:

** ERT integration
** Documentation using Doxygen

* If you want to try out this branch together with the latest changes in the main
  branch, do this:

  git clone -b cmake http://github.com/OPM/opm-core opm-core-cmake
  pushd opm-core-cmake
  git pull --strategy=ours origin master

* Steps to build using CMake:

  cmake ../../src/opm-core -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  ../../src/opm-core/build

* Notice that a very simple form of 'configure' also works.
