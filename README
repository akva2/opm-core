This is the "cmake" branch of opm-core. Its purpose is to use CMake instead of
Autotools as building system. It should be viewed as an experimental branch, and
is not (yet) suitable to use as a base for further development of the C++ code.

The following features are deliberately disabled:

* ERT           (uses -std=gnu99, must write probe for that first)
* AGMG          (uses Fortran compiler, must search for source code)
* installation  (premature)
