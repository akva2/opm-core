This is the "cmake" branch of opm-core. Its purpose is to use CMake instead of
Autotools as building system. It should be viewed as an experimental branch, and
is not (yet) suitable to use as a base for further development of the C++ code.

The following features are deliberately disabled:

* ERT           (uses -std=gnu99, must write probe for that first)
* AGMG          (uses Fortran compiler, must search for source code)
* Documentation

cmake ../../src/opm-core -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
ionice -c2 -n7 nice make -j \
  $(echo "("$(grep -P -c '^processor\t:' /proc/cpuinfo)+1")"/1 | bc)

Notice that a very simple form of 'configure' also works.
